# Stock Price Analysis and Forecasting
## Overview
This Python script provides an analysis of stock prices using various financial ratios and machine learning techniques. It aims to generate buy or sell signals based on predefined criteria, forecast future prices using Prophet and SARIMAX (ARIMA) models, and utilize the XGBoost algorithm for enhanced predictions.

## Features
### 1. Data Download and Preprocessing
Data Source: Yahoo Finance API
Date Range: From 'START_DATE' to 'END_DATE'
Financial Ratios Calculated:
Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
Price-to-Book (P/B)
Daily Change and Return
Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio)
Growth Score (5-day rolling mean)
Durability Score (20-day rolling mean)
Momentum Score (30-day rolling mean)
Profitability Score (5-day rolling mean)
Red Flags (Difference between the maximum close price in the last 10 days and the current close price)
### 2. Intrinsic Value Calculation
Intrinsic value is calculated as 90% of the closing stock price.
### 3. Buy/Sell Signal Generation
Buy Signal: Triggered when Red Flags exceed 0.05
Sell Signal: Triggered when Red Flags drop below -0.05
### 4. Machine Learning for Price Prediction
Features: P/E, P/B, Change, Return, PB Ratio, Growth Score, Durability Score, Momentum Score, Profitability Score
Target: Closing stock price shifted by one day
Algorithm: XGBoost Regressor with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
### 5. Time Series Forecasting
Prophet Forecasting:
Utilizes Facebook Prophet to forecast stock prices.
SARIMAX (ARIMA) Forecasting:
Applies Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model using statsmodels.
### 6. Visualization
Plots the stock price along with intrinsic value, buy/sell signals, and forecasted prices from Prophet and SARIMAX.
### 7. Right Prices to Buy and Sell
Calculates the right prices to buy and sell based on the last intrinsic value and the last forecasted price.
### 8. Additional Information
The script can be extended or modified for specific stock analysis and forecasting requirements.
Customize intrinsic value calculation and buy/sell signal criteria as needed.
