# Stock Price Analysis and Forecasting
## Overview
This Python script analyzes historical stock prices, calculates financial ratios, generates buy/sell signals based on predefined criteria, and forecasts future stock prices using two different models: Facebook Prophet and SARIMAX (ARIMA). The script also provides insights into the right prices to buy and sell the stock and an analyzed price to sell for booking profit.

## Features
### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Source: Yahoo Finance API
Date Range: From 'START_DATE' to 'END_DATE'
Financial Ratios Calculated:
Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
Price-to-Book (P/B)
Daily Change and Return
Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio)
Growth Score (5-day rolling mean)
Durability Score (20-day rolling mean)
Momentum Score (30-day rolling mean)
Profitability Score (5-day rolling mean)
Red Flags (Difference between the maximum close price in the last 10 days and the current close price)
### 2. Intrinsic Value Calculation
Intrinsic value is calculated as 90% of the closing stock price.
### 3. Buy/Sell Signal Generation
Buy Signal: Triggered when Red Flags exceed 0.05
Sell Signal: Triggered when Red Flags drop below -0.05
Analyzed Price to Sell for Booking Profit: If there are recent sell signals, an analyzed price to sell is calculated as 110% of the last sell signal.
### 4. Time Series Forecasting
Prophet Forecasting:
Utilizes Facebook Prophet to forecast stock prices.
SARIMAX (ARIMA) Forecasting:
Applies Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model using statsmodels.
### 5. Visualization
Plots the stock price along with intrinsic value, buy/sell signals, and forecasted prices from Prophet and SARIMAX.
### 6. Output
Provides the right prices to buy and sell the stock based on the last intrinsic value and the last forecasted price.
If there are recent sell signals, an analyzed price to sell for booking profit is displayed.
